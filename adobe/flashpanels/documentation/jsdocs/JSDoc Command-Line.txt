When making JSDocs of the samples, make sure JSDoc is installed on the computer. Search for "JSDocs" on SourceForge:

Go to the directory of JSDocs where jsdoc.pl is contained.

You can make the modifications but this is what works on my computer. Keep in mind that your target is to place within the jsdoc folder in the documentation folder.

sudo perl jsdoc.pl /Perforce/photoshop/main/sdk/flashpanels/public/samples/ --extensions jsx -r --directory /Perforce/photoshop/main/sdk/flashpanels/public/documentation/jsdoc
